# TankBrain
Official repository for TankBrain, a replacement board for Academy and other motorized vehicle models

# What is this?
This is an Arduino-compatible* board with remote controller that replaces either the old 30/40MHz band remote control or wired remote on models from Academy Plastic Models or other companies.
Currently it supports Academy's wired motorized tank models (the benchmark being their ROK K1A1 tank model), but with some support it should be easy to make it support nearly all models.

\*: Arduino-compatible in this context means "Arduino IDE compatible". The board in no way, shape or form can support peripherals made for Arduino Uno and other boards.
